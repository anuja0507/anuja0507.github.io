# PowerBI Project:
Education domain has a significant importance in shaping effective learning experiences. 
Data analytics in education is the use of data to understand and improve educational processes, practices, and outcomes. 
It can involve different types of data, such as student demographics, attendance, grades, test scores, enrollment, behavior etc. 

Here I have come up with School performance reports for **Victoria School District(VISD)** focusing 2 key areas - **Enrollment** & **Attendance**.
Please note: This is a dummy project with name VISD and does not contain actual data of the district.

# Business goal: 
Teachers should be able to identify strengths and potential areas for improvement in terms of Enrollments & Attendance. 
The level of detail provided by the School Performance Report should support schools to improve their 
strategic planning by identifying key areas for improvement and enabling schools to access targeted supports 
for improved outcomes.\
**Audience:**
Teachers & principals.

# My Approach:

**Data Acquisition:**\
-Generated 2 years of data for 5 sample schools.

**Data Cleansing:**\
-Standardized data formats\
-Standardized data types\
-Rename columns and tables with meanigful names.

**Data Transformation:**\
-Created calculated Columns\
-Find data anomalies and data statistics (Column Profiling & values distribution)

**Data Modeling:**\
-Built a cohesive star schema model within Power BI to establish relationships between different data sets.\
-Cross filter direction is set correctly.\
-Added date table & cerated hierarchy for time intelligence calculations and marked it as a date table.
