### Category Name 1 

[I am a highly passionate and process-oriented data enthusiast with 10.5 years of experience, offering in-depth knowledge of database concepts, data analysis, data integration, and data visualization. This includes over 2 years of experience working with leading cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP. My background in both technical and analytical roles positions me as an ideal bridge between business and technical teams. My passion for data, combined with my highly organized nature, makes me well-suited for working with data platforms.

Currently, I am on a strategic career pause, having taken maternity leave from May 2023 to focus on raising my child. During this time, I developed valuable skills in time management, problem-solving, and multitasking, which further strengthened my ability to prioritize and handle diverse tasks effectively. Now, I am excited to re-enter the workforce with renewed enthusiasm and energy, eager to contribute to a dynamic team and apply my expertise once again.

I have gained experience working across geographies such as India, the USA and Australia, navigating multicultural and challenging environments while collaborating with international teams and stakeholders to deliver impactful, data-driven insights and solutions. This experience has enhanced my understanding of diverse business cultures and industry standards, making me more versatile and adaptable.](/sample_page)
